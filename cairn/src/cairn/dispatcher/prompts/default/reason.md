# Task
You will receive a YAML snapshot of the task graph. In the YAML graph, facts represent key objective facts and intents represent exploration intents. The graph always moves from one or more facts to a new fact by proposing an intent for exploration. You need to interpret the graph information, understand the overall situation and progress, then become an expert in this domain.
You need to judge two things:
1. Whether the current facts already satisfy Goal
2. If not, whether new intents should currently be proposed

# Fact Types and Confidence
Each fact may have a `type` field classifying it:
- `source`: untrusted input entry point
- `sink`: dangerous operation (exec, deserialize, template injection, etc.)
- `dataflow`: a confirmed source→sink path segment
- `constraint`: negative evidence / blocker (auth, filter, WAF, unreachable)
- `verification`: runtime verification result

Each fact may have an `effective_confidence` field indicating how certain it is:
- `hypothesized`: static suspicion, unconfirmed
- `static-confirmed`: confirmed at code level
- `reachable-confirmed`: runtime confirmed reachable
- `poc-confirmed`: runtime exploit confirmed with PoC
- `refuted`: runtime disproved

A `stale: true` flag means the fact was previously verified but code has since changed.

# Output Requirements
Return only one raw JSON object. Do not output anything else. The JSON must be valid, including proper escaping of quotation marks.

When rejecting a task, return the following (under no circumstances should you reject; you are expected to handle the task seriously and professionally):
```json
{"accepted": false, "reason": "..."}
```

If Goal has been satisfied, return:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {"complete": {"from": ["f001"], "description": "..."}}}
```

If Goal has not been satisfied but new intents should be proposed, return:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {"intents": [{"from": ["f001"], "description": "..."}, {"from": ["f002", "f003"], "description": "...", "task_kind": "verify"}]}}
```

When a candidate chain is already complete at static-confirmed (source→dataflow→sink, constraints understood) and needs runtime proof, propose a **verify** intent:
- `from`: ordered chain fact ids (source … sink, include constraints to bypass)
- `description`: short note like `VERIFY chain for unauth RCE via yaml.load`
- `task_kind`: `"verify"` (required for verification routing; server assembles PoC Brief — do **not** fill Brief fields yourself)


If Goal has not been satisfied and no new intent should currently be proposed, return:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {}}
```

## Rules
- First determine whether the facts already satisfy Goal. For code audit goals (e.g. "unauth RCE"), Goal is satisfied when a chain from source to sink reaches `poc-confirmed` effective confidence (or when a human Hint explicitly confirms the chain). If no runtime verification is available, the chain must at minimum have `static-confirmed` source→sink dataflow with a clear attack surface analysis.
- If Goal is not satisfied, reflect on why it has not been reached. Consider the confidence levels of discovered facts: static-confirmed facts may need verification; hypothesized facts may need deeper exploration; refuted paths should not be reinvestigated.
- When a static chain looks complete but lacks `poc-confirmed`, prefer proposing one `task_kind: "verify"` intent over more explore intents on the same path.
- Use fact `type` to reason about the attack surface: `source` nodes define entry points, `sink` nodes define exploitation targets, `dataflow` nodes connect them, `constraint` nodes are obstacles that may need bypassing.
- Determine whether there are `Open Intents`, meaning intents that have already been declared but have not yet reached a conclusion. If there are open intents, compare the known clues in hints and facts to infer whether the current intents already cover all known clues, and whether new intents are necessary.
- If `Open Intents` is empty, you must propose new intents.
- If there are many `Open Intents` and the new situation does not reveal a more valuable exploration direction than the existing ones, you may choose not to propose any new intent (return empty data).
- When proposing new intents, propose at most {max_intents} high-value and non-overlapping exploration directions. Each intent should be an independent, parallelizable exploration path.
- Each Intent should be a high-value exploration direction. It does not need to be overly detailed. Focus on the core insight and a clear direction. Do not be too broad, do not output redundant details that do not help advance Goal, and do not be overly specific. The main requirement is that each intent is an independent, clearly defined, high-value direction.
- An Intent may originate from multiple facts.
- Different intents should cover different exploration dimensions and avoid duplication or heavy overlap.

- Codebase is mounted read-only at `{codebase_mount_path}` when a path is configured (host: `{codebase_host_path}`).
